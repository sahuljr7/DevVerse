## Problem Statement
[LeetCode Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/)

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
  int trap(vector<int>& height) {  // Define a function to calculate trapped rainwater given a vector of heights.
    const int n = height.size();  // Store the size of the input vector.
    int ans = 0;  // Initialize a variable to store the total trapped rainwater.
    vector<int> l(n);  // Declare a vector to store the maximum height from the left side for each position.
    vector<int> r(n);  // Declare a vector to store the maximum height from the right side for each position.

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)  // Loop through the input vector.
      l[i] = i == 0 ? height[i] : max(height[i], l[i - 1]);  // Fill the left array with the maximum height encountered so far from the left.

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i)  // Loop through the input vector in reverse.
      r[i] = i == n - 1 ? height[i] : max(height[i], r[i + 1]);  // Fill the right array with the maximum height encountered so far from the right.

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)  // Loop through the input vector.
      ans += min(l[i], r[i]) - height[i];  // Calculate the trapped water at each position and accumulate it to the total.

    return ans;  // Return the total trapped rainwater.
  }
};
```

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize variables: `ans` for storing total trapped water.
2. Iterate over the heights from left to right, filling the `l` array with the maximum height encountered so far from the left.
3. Iterate over the heights from right to left, filling the `r` array with the maximum height encountered so far from the right.
4. Iterate over each height, calculate the trapped water at each position using the minimum of maximum heights from both sides and subtracting the current height.
5. Accumulate the trapped water for each position to the `ans` variable.
6. Return the total trapped water (`ans`).

### Time Complexity:
- The code runs through the input vector three times linearly (`O(n)`).
- So, the time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- Additional space is used for storing two arrays (`l` and `r`), each of size `n`.
- So, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Reducing Complexity:
- The space complexity can be reduced to `O(1)` by using two pointers to keep track of the maximum heights from left and right instead of using arrays. 

Here's the optimized code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) { // Function to calculate trapped rainwater given a vector of heights.
        int n = height.size(); // Store the size of the input vector.
        int left = 0, right = n - 1; // Initialize two pointers, left and right, at the beginning and end of the vector respectively.
        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0; // Initialize variables to store the maximum height encountered from the left and right sides respectively.
        int ans = 0; // Initialize a variable to store the total trapped rainwater.

        while (left < right) { // Loop until the left pointer crosses the right pointer.
            if (height[left] < height[right]) { // If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer.
                if (height[left] >= leftMax) // If the height at the left pointer is greater than or equal to the left maximum encountered so far.
                    leftMax = height[left]; // Update the left maximum.
                else // If the height at the left pointer is less than the left maximum encountered so far.
                    ans += leftMax - height[left]; // Calculate and add the trapped water at the current position to the total.
                left++; // Move the left pointer to the next position.
            } else { // If the height at the left pointer is greater than or equal to the height at the right pointer.
                if (height[right] >= rightMax) // If the height at the right pointer is greater than or equal to the right maximum encountered so far.
                    rightMax = height[right]; // Update the right maximum.
                else // If the height at the right pointer is less than the right maximum encountered so far.
                    ans += rightMax - height[right]; // Calculate and add the trapped water at the current position to the total.
                right--; // Move the right pointer to the previous position.
            }
        }
        return ans; // Return the total trapped rainwater.
    }
};
```

### Optimized Time and Space Complexity:
- Time Complexity: `O(n)` as the algorithm still traverses the heights once.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)` as it uses only constant space for variables.
