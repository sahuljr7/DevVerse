### Inline Code

Inline Code is a great way to add code to your documentation.

`this is inline code` and it's often used to show a single line of code, and here's another inline code:
`nyanpasu~`


```py
import datetime

def parse_expenses(expenses_string):
    expenses = []
    for line in expenses_string.splitlines():
        if line.startswith("#"):
            continue
        date, value, currency = line.split(" ")
        expenses.append((datetime.datetime.strptime(date, "%Y-%m-%d"),
                         float(value),
                         currency))
    return expenses
```
